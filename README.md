Education generates vast amounts of data, yet turning that data into meaningful insights remains a challenge for many institutions. In this project, I explored how student performance data can be transformed into clear, actionable insights using Microsoft Excel. 
Using Microsoft Excel, this analysis explores how factors such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental education level, lunch quality, and test preparation courses influence student performance across mathematics, reading, and writing.The final output is an interactive dashboard supported by a structured technical report, designed to aid data-driven decision-making in education.

 Objectives

Analyze student performance across multiple demographic and academic factors

Identify performance patterns and disparities

Evaluate the impact of test preparation programs

Present insights through an interactive Excel dashboard

Provide actionable recommendations for academic improvement


 Dataset Description

The dataset contains student-level academic records with the following attributes:

Gender

Race/Ethnicity (Groups A–E)

Mathematics Score

Reading Score

Writing Score

Parental Level of Education

Lunch Quality

Test Preparation Course Status


 Methodology

The analysis followed a structured process:
1. Classified variables into dependent (academic scores) and independent factors
2. Cleaned and validated the dataset for accuracy and consistency
3. Used pivot tables to aggregate scores by gender, race, and other factor
4. Designed an Excel dashboard with KPIs and comparative visualizations
5. Analyzed the impact of test preparation and socioeconomic indicators
6. Documented findings in a technical report

 Key Findings

Female students consistently outperform male students across all subjects
Ethnic Group C records the highest overall academic performance
Reading is the strongest-performing subject overall
Students who completed test preparation courses achieved significantly higher scores
Performance gaps exist among certain ethnic groups, indicating the need for targeted interventions

 Dashboard Features
